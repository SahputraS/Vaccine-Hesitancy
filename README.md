# Vaccine-Hesitancy

In this group project, we extended the classic SIR (Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) model by introducing vaccine and death compartments, creating a more detailed SIRV framework. We also added hesitant, pro-vax, and anti-vax states to represent different attitudes toward vaccination. The epidemic is simulated on a Barabási–Albert scale-free network, which realistically captures how a few highly connected “hub” nodes and numerous peripheral nodes influence disease spread.

We then examined how both local and global factors shape the decisions of hesitant individuals. Each susceptible–hesitant node considers infection/death rates in its immediate neighborhood and the overall epidemic status across the network. This dual perspective determines whether a hesitant person opts for vaccination or remains anti-vax, highlighting how personal choices can be guided by close social circles as well as broader public health conditions.
