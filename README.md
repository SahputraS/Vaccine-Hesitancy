# Vaccine-Hesitancy

In this group project, we extended the classic SIR (Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) model by introducing vaccine and death compartments, resulting in a more detailed SIRV framework. 
We incorporate hesitant, pro-vax, and anti-vax states to capture different attitudes toward vaccination. The epidemic spreads on a Barabási–Albert scale-free network.

We examined how local and global factors influence hesitant individuals’ decisions. Each susceptible–hesitant node considers the infection/death among its immediate neighbors and the broader epidemic status across the network. 
This dual perspective determines whether a hesitant person chooses to vaccinate or to become anti-vaccine, illustrating how personal choices can be guided by close social circles as well as overall public health conditions.
